In my final project, I was able to build a web application where users can post items for sell. Similar to all my previous 
projects I learned so much working on this one. The user have to create an account in order to post a listing which will 
then be visible to anyone checking the web application. 

To be able to create an account, the user has to enter a few information about himself such as his name, a username and a password. He is also required to enter his contact information to allow anybody whoâ€™s interested in one of his isting to reach out to him. 

After successfully creating an account the user can post an item for sell. He will be redirected to a form by clicking on 
one of the links available at homepage, where he can enter various information about the product that he is selling, 
including a picture of the item. After posting the product, it will be available to everyone to see even to someone who is 
not logged in, but the only person that can edit the post or delete it is the post creator himself.

This project is one of my favorites so far because I got to learn so many new concepts while building it. This is the first 
time I have to build something that requires the user to upload pictures from their computer. I spent hours trying to 
figure how to do that on react and also how to display the images on the home page. I also learned how to use redux-
persist package, which helps you save your Redux state object to a persisted storage. Then on app launch it retrieves 
this persisted state and saves it back to redux. This package was very helpful with  building this app especially because 
I am checking authentication and authorization every time the user refresh a page.
