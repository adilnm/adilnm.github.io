In my JavaScript project I built a single page web application that can be very useful for students as a reminder of all  their projects and assignments of each of their semester classes.  I used Rails in the backend and JavaScript in the frontend.

The biggest addition in this project as opposed to the previous ones, is the use of JavaScript as a frontend and also apply the AJAX concept to be able to display different updates to the page and submit new data to the database without refreshing the page. 

In my application the user had to fill out a course form, which will lead to create a course card that has all the entered information. Within that card  there will be another assignment form where the user gets to input all the information about a particular assignment, for example the name, the type and the deadline. Upon submission the assignment will show up inside the course card with all its information. The user can always update any information provided through the form and also sort the different assignments of every course by deadline.

As in my previous projects I learned how to use a lot of new powerful concepts while building this web application, especially Ajax conccept that creates a much better user interface experience. I also got to experience how create an application with rails as backend Api and JavaScript as a frontend and how to link them to each other.
