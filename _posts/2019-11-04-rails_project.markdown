For my Rails project I built a web application called RestauReservation, which helps people find most of the restaurants worldwide. Have you ever landed in a city for the first time and you found yourself not sure what and where to eat? This web application can help anyone find a place to have a good meal or a few drinks and it also shows the rating of the place picked by the user. 

I used a website called Zomato to pull out data through API such as restaurants names, addresses, phone numbers etc. The user starts by signing up either by entering a few information about himself such name, email and age, or he can also sign up through his Facebook account, which can be much more convenient for most people. After finishing the sign up process the user will be redirected to the reservations page where he can see all different reservations that he made in the past. He can also edit, delete or make a new one by clicking on the 'Make reservation' Button. 

This project was a great learning experience for me since I was able for the first time to learn how to pull out data from an API and make it useful in a rails application. I also got to be more comfortable with the OmniAuth concept, and the use of a third party website to get the users to log in. Finally  I am very happy with the final result of this project and I am looking forward the next section
