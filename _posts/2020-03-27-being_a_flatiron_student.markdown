I had a great experience learning how to code at Flatiron school bootcamp. Looking back at how I improved as a programmer within a few months period is amazing.  At Flatiron school I learned mainly two different languages, Ruby on the backend and JavaScript on the front end. I also got to be good at a few libraries and frameworks such as Sinatra, Ruby on rails and React. But I feel that the important thing that I learned from being a student at Flatiron school is how to be a great programmer. When I started the bootcamp I knew a few programming concepts, I was able to build some simple projects but I donâ€™t think I was a good programmer. At Flatiron I learned how to be a great programmer and how to deal with coding challenges in a very efficient way. I learned the different steps to take while trying to debug a code, I learned how to be calm and patient in certain situation and not let imposter syndrome get the best of me. Overall it has been a great experience that got me ready to start looking for a job in tech, and become a professional web developer.
