Another great experience building something from scratch. I was able to build a web application using Sinatra library that 
might help a lot of students. How many times as a student you get overwhelmed by a number of classes that you are taking every semester and their multiple assignments? Sometimes you might even forget some of your homework or the due dates of some of the class projects. That’s exactly why I thought of building this web application. A student will be able to list all the classes he is taking with their respective assignments. It also includes information like the class professor, final grades and some details about every assignment.

I in this project I was able to use most of what I learned at Flatiron school thus far, which showed me a lot of growth in my ability to code and build something useful. There was of course sometimes where it wasn’t easy to get what I am trying to do to work the way I want it to, but with doing some research online or going back to the lectures, I was always able to get through those moments.

As a conclusion, building this web application was a fun and educational experience that I am very pleased with. I am also pretty sure it is a great foundation for what’s coming in the next section.
