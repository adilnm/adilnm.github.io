###         Building a project from scratch is so much different than passing a few test in a programming lab. It was so much fun being able to do everything from start to finish. My project idea is based on building a Ruby gem that displays over a hundred birds to the user, and then educates them about any bird of their choice by providing multiple options to choose from.  After finding the website that I would be scraping data from, my first step was to write all the steps that would help me achieve my final goal on a piece of paper. By doing that I was able to design a path for my approach that kept me very well organized, but I was also ready to deviate from my first plan whenever I have to. 
###  When the user run the gem they get greeted first and then they get introduced to over one hundred numbered bird names that they will be asked to choose from.  The next step the user gets to pick a bird number of their choice. If the input is not valid the user gets asked again to type in a valid number, otherwise the terminal will display a brief description of the bird that was picked. Some of the birds didnâ€™t have a description included in the website, so I decided to display a short message to the user apologizing for the missing information whenever one of those birds gets picked. The next step is asking the user if they want to know more about the bird that was picked. If they decided to do that, they will get to choose one of five different categories, which are distribution, habitat, diet, breeding, status and fun fact. The user then gets to pick the one that they want to know more about. There is always an option to go back and pick another bird and also an option to exit the program.
### Overall this was a great experience that I learned a lot from, there was of course some moments of struggle, but with going back to the old lectures and doing some online search, I was able to get through those moments and get the project done.
