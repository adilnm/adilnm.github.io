At first programming was nothing more than a hobby. It was very interesting for me that I can build some powerful projects from scratch without the need of anything more than a laptop, Internet connection and some programming knowledge. I love the creative aspect of coding, because I feel like I can build a lot of things that can be very helpful to humanity and can make a big difference in people’s lives.  Of course coding is not easy; it takes a lot of practice and dedication to get comfortable with it. There were a lot of times while I was trying to understand a new concept, when I felt that nothing makes sense to me anymore and that everything is confusing, but the key was always to relax and not panic because sometime I feel like when I am trying too much nothing makes sense anymore. Finally if you ever feel like you don’t belong and that you may not do succeed in programing give yourself another chance because everybody feels the same way multiple times while trying to learn how to code.
